# Diff Tools


## Initial difference behavior

Behavior when an input is verified for the first time.

Behavior depends on if an [EmptyFiles](https://github.com/SimonCropp/EmptyFiles) can be found matching the current extension.

 * If an EmptyFiles can be found matching the current extension, then the tool will be launched to compare the input to that empty file.
 * If no EmptyFiles can be found no tool will be launched.


## Detected difference behavior

Behavior when a difference is detected between the input and an existing current verified file.


### Not Running

If no tool is running for the comparison of the current verification (per test), a new tool instance will be launched.


### Is Running

If a tool is running for the comparison of the current verification (per test), and a new verification fails, the following logic will be applied:

| Auto Refresh | Mdi   | Behavior |
|--------------|-------|----------|
| true         | true  | No action. Current instance will refresh |
| true         | false | No action. Current instance will refresh |
| false        | true  | Open new instance. Previous instance must be manually closed |
| false        | false | Kill current and open new instance |

## MaxInstancesToLaunch

By default a maximum of 5 tool instances will be launched. This prevents a change that breaks many tests from causing too much load on a machine.

This value can be changed using an environment variable or by explicitly specifying the value by code. When both are used, the environment variable value will be used.


### Using an environment variable

Setting the `DiffEngine_MaxInstances` environment variable to the number of instances to launch.

This value can also be set using [the DiffEngineTray options dialog](/docs/tray.md#max-instances-to-launch).


### Using code

snippet: MaxInstancesToLaunch


## Left/Right diff behavior

By default, when a diff is opened, the temp file is on the left and the target file is on the right.

This value can be changed by setting the `DiffEngine_TargetOnLeft` environment variable to `true`.

This value can also be set using [the DiffEngineTray options dialog](/docs/tray.md#open-on-left).


## Successful verification behavior

If a tool is running for the comparison of the current verification (per test), and a new verification passes, the following logic will be applied:

| Mdi   | Behavior |
|-------|----------|
| true  | No action taken. Previous instance must be manually closed |
| false | Kill current instance |

## Disable orphaned process detection

Resharper has a feature [Check for orphaned processes spawned by test runner](https://www.jetbrains.com/help/resharper/Reference__Options__Tools__Unit_Testing__Test_Runner.html).

> By default, ReSharper maintains a list of all processes that are launched by the executed tests. If some of theses processes do not exit after the test execution is over, ReSharper will suggest you to terminate the process. If your setup requires some processes started by the tests to continue running, you can clear this checkbox to avoid unnecessary notifications.

Since this project launches diff tools, it will trigger this feature and a dialog will show:

> All unit tests are finished, but child processes spawned by the test runner process are still running. Terminate child process?

As such this feature needs to be disabled:

## Supported Tools:

Tools location is automatically detected. If a tool installed in a custom location, it can be manually configured using an environment variable, that points to the executable. The environment variable format is `DiffEngine_{ToolName}`.
