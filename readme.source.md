## [Supported Tools](/docs/diff-tool.md#supported-tools)

include: diffToolList


## Launching a tool

A tool can be launched using the following:

snippet: DiffRunnerLaunch

Note that this method will respect the above [difference behavior](/docs/diff-tool.md#detected-difference-behavior) in terms of Auto refresh and MDI behaviors.


## Closing a tool

A tool can be closed using the following:

snippet: DiffRunnerKill

Note that this method will respect the above [difference behavior](/docs/diff-tool.md#detected-difference-behavior) in terms of MDI behavior.


## File type detection

DiffEngine use [EmptyFiles](https://github.com/SimonCropp/EmptyFiles) to determine if a given file or extension is a binary or text. Custom extensions can be added, or existing ones changed.


## BuildServerDetector

`BuildServerDetector.Detected` returns true if the current code is running on a build/CI server.
